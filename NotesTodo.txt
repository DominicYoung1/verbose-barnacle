**CONSIDER**
	1.Constructing a "file" that the program will "read" when crafting to world
		**OPTIONS**
			1.Having a web of nested text files that are read in an acsending order to eventually be read into the program and used to make the world
	2.As health and healing is introduced as well as more actions for NPC's we need combat to be more turn based, so we need to prompt the user after a round of combat and present them with action options.
	3.Continue to work on the map/more Rooms.
